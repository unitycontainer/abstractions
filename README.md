# Message To Community

Dear community,

I am [Eugene Sadovoi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esadovoi/) ([ENikS](https://github.com/ENikS)), maintainer of the [Unity container](https://github.com/unitycontainer). Back in 2017 I wanted to fix few Unity issues, related to my work for an employer, but ended up adopting the whole project. Initially I worked on the library during my free time, but it became [very obvious very quick](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/issues/199#issuecomment-746006052) that Unity is not a hobbyist software.

In July of 2019 I started to work on Unity full time. During this time a lot was accomplished:

* New [engine](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/release/6.0.0) compatible with .NET 5.0 is almost done
* More that [100 issues](https://github.com/orgs/unitycontainer/projects/3) were identified and fixed
* More than 2000 [regression tests](https://github.com/unitycontainer?q=regression) were created
* Performance of v6.0 engine improved dramatically
* Work on back-porting fixes into [Unity v5.12.x](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/tree/release/5.12.0) (LTS) started

The effort was privately funded and lasted until recently. But now the future of [Unity container](https://github.com/unitycontainer) is at stake. 

## [Make Unity sustainable](https://opencollective.com/unity-container)

The community support is crucial for the projects to survive and to move forward.
Unity is all about trust and sharing. [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/unity-container) lets finances to be managed so everyone can see where money comes from and where it goes. It was selected to provide mechanism for the community to support and finance the project.

If your project depends on [Unity container](https://github.com/unitycontainer) and you want it to be maintainer and developed, please **[support](https://opencollective.com/unity-container)** it. Remember, I can have only one full time job, so without proper financial backing there will be no more releases beyond v5.11
