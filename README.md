# [Make Unity sustainable](https://opencollective.com/unity-container)

The community support is crucial for the projects to survive and to move forward.
Unity is all about trust and sharing. [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/unity-container) lets finances to be managed so everyone can see where money comes from and where it goes. It was selected to provide mechanism for the community to support and finance the project.

If your project depends on [Unity container](https://github.com/unitycontainer) and you want it to be maintainer and developed, please **[support](https://opencollective.com/unity-container)** it. Remember, I can have only one full time job, so without proper financial backing there will be no more releases beyond v5.11
